# cf-example-datasets

CF example datasets

This repo is used to store the example datasets for the CF conventions.

It contains both code to generate examples as well as the examples themselves.

## Structure of this Repo

The examples are in Examples sub-dir -- labeled with arbitrary numbers:

```
example0001
example0002
...
```

Each example dir contains everything relevant to that example -- it could be only the example itself, or it could be code used to generate the example, etc.

Notes about the example should be put in a README.txt file in that  dir.


## How to add a new example:

1) Create a branch (if you are a member of the repo) or a Fork (if you are not) of the repo.

2) Make a copy of  the 00example_template directory.

3) Give it a name that is the next number after the last existing number, e.g. if the last one is `example1234` give yours `example1235`.

4) Update the README.txt file to reflect your example

5) Add the example, any code used to generate it, etc.

6) When you think it's ready, make a Pull Request to the main branch, and wait for the team to accept  it.
